                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>During my months as a web development intern with Markworth, I spent most of that time building the company website. Learning to build websites using Odoo was a huge learning curve, as I was so used to building webpages from scratch. Odoo's WYSIWYG website editor gave me a good challenge, as it didn't provide the level of flexibility that I was used to having with my own code.</p>
                    <p>I got the hang of it, though, and I feel that it was well worth the effort.</p>

                    <p>This blog was for an assignment – partly to solidify the concepts from class, and partly to generate traffic by giving us students a way to interact with each other's sites.</p>
                    <p>I spent a long time playing with WordPress and getting a feel for it before I felt ready to publish my blog. Navigating the Gutenberg editor was a little challenging, as much of the documentation and tutorials that I was following were created for the Classic Editor, so it took a little while to learn my way around.</p>
