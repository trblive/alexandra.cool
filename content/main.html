                a double diploma next year, in front- and back-end dev (at the same time!!)</p>
            <p>I probably won't be working while I'm still studying, but keep an eye on this site to see what I

                    <p>Everything I've learned in the last year has contributed to this project.
                        I started working on it in May, where it started with just the front
                        end, and have been gradually updating and improving it ever since.</p>
                    <p>This website is the home of every assignment I've done – as well as my
                        hours spent experimenting outside the task requirements – each of them
                        challenging me to take this project further. I've become so comfortable
                        working with the front end, and my shaky back end will only continue to
                        improve.</p>
                    <p>It'll forever be a work in progress, but it's a labour of love.</p>

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>During my months as a web development intern with Markworth, I spent
                        most of that time building the company website. Learning to build websites
                        using Odoo was a huge learning curve, as I was so used to building webpages
                        from scratch. The Odoo website module uses a block editor, which I initially
                        found to be very challenging, as it just didn't provide the level of flexibility
                        that I was used to having with my own code.</p>
                    <p>I got the hang of it, though, and I feel that it was well worth the effort.</p>

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>This blog was for an assignment – partly to solidify the concepts from class, and
                        partly to generate traffic by giving us a way to interact with each other's sites.</p>
                    <p>I spent a long time playing with WordPress and getting a feel for it before I felt
                        ready to publish my blog. Navigating the Gutenberg editor was a little challenging,
                        as much of the documentation and tutorials that I was following were created for the
                        Classic Editor, so it took a little while to learn my way around.</p>
                    <p>I'm definitely eager to continue working with WordPress, and to learn more about developing
                        for a WordPress environment.</p>
