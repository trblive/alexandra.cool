                                                    being presented with the login form again. We need a way to
                                                    tell the user what went wrong in this situation; this template
                                                    will check if a variable named $loginError exists, and if so,
                                                    will display it above the form - Page 290  -->

                                                    be submitted back to the same URL that produced it. Thus, if the
                                                    user’s login attempt is successful, the controller will display
                                                    the page that the browser originally requested - Page 291 -->

                                                    This tells the browser to hide the value that the user types in, to shield
                                                    the password from prying eyes - Page 291 -->

                                                    userIsLoggedIn function that the user has submitted
                                                    this form in an attempt to log in. You might be tempted simply to
                                                    put the name="action" attribute on the submit button’s <input> tag
                                                    and watch for that—but if the user submits the form by hitting Enter while
                                                    editing one of the two text fields, the submit button will not be sent with
                                                    the form. Using a hidden field like this ensures Cookies, Sessions, and Access
                                                    Control that the action variable will be submitted no matter how the submission

                                                    page is protected until they see the login form. We therefore provide a link
