        <p>Search engine optimisation is one of the biggest things to worry about when running a website. No matter how
            fantastic you might think your website is, we all have to please the Almighty Algorithm if we want to be
            rewarded with those sparkly search rankings. But don’t worry! I’ve done the worrying already, and I’ve
            compiled a reference list of all the resources and totally legal tricks I’ve found helpful.</p>
        <p>Don’t want to read it all? Me neither. See

        <h3>On-page SEO</h3>
        <p>On-page SEO is the practice of optimising the actual content of a website so that it is useful for both
            search engines and human users. We have to actually put effort into what we publish online – who knew?</p>
        <p>Most importantly, this means writing good-quality, meaningful content that is relevant to what users are
            searching for. Work out what keywords you are targeting and include them in your content, else you won’t
            show up when users search for these terms. This can include in meta tags, image alt text, headers, and title
            tags. Aim for somewhere between 0.5% and 2.5% keyword density – an overabundance of keywords becomes spammy
            and annoying, and is harmful to search engine rankings.</p>
        <p>It is also important to update your content regularly and often. Refresh older pages and posts with up to
            date, well written information, instead of posting once and leaving it to die. It can be beneficial to use
            multiple media types, such as images, videos, and audio, as these are often more interesting than text alone,
            however it is important to still present these in an accessible format.</p>
        <p>Finally, your website should be easily navigable, with plenty of internal links to help users find information
            deeper within your site. At the very least, you should include a navigation menu to direct users to the key
            areas of your site. It may also be worth including breadcrumb navigation or pagination to further help users
            find their way around.</p>
        <h3>Off-page SEO</h3>
        <p>Off-page SEO is everything that’s “not SEO” but is important for success of a website. Usually, this is in the
            form of link-building. This can come from things such as social media marketing, content marketing, ratings
            and reviews, and directory listings, to name a few – anything that helps build your brand and direct traffic
            to your website. Diverse, high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites means a lot more for search
            engine rankings than asking your friends to link to your website (but that’s still way better than nothing!!).</p>
        <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
        <p>Technical SEO is all the big stuff involved in actually getting your site online and findable. Essentially,
            this is practice of making sure that web crawlers can crawl your site and understand the site content.
            Search algorithms reward well written, well-maintained websites. Here are just some of the things that
            technical SEO entails:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Above everything else, <span class="bold">make your site crawlable.</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the very least, create a sitemap and submit it to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster
                        Tools to help web crawlers index your site. Be sure to update it as you add or remove webpages,
                        so that your submitted site structure stays up to date.</li>
                    <li>Utilise robots.txt to control which search bots can crawl your site (in case you want to block
                        some of them)</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Improve user experience by <span class="bold">optimising Core Web Vitals.</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>There’s nothing more annoying than bad UX. Core Web Vitals can be found in Google Search Console,
                        but you can also see suggestions by checking Page Speed Insights. These include metrics such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – how long it takes a webpage to load the largest element.</li>
                            <li>First Input Delay (FID) – how long it takes the webpage to respond to the user’s first interaction.</li>
                            <li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – how the webpage layout changes as various elements load.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>To optimise Core Web Vitals, aim for these scores:
                        <ul>
                            <li>LCP: 2.5s or less</li>
                            <li>FID: 100ms or less</li>
                            <li>CLS: 0.1 or less</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Optimising Core Web Vitals also improves the page load time.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Make sure to use a <span class="bold">findable domain name.</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domain names should be unique, memorable, and relevant to the website topic, without being too
                        long or overly complicated. </li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><span class="bold">Use HTTPS</span>, as it is favoured by search engines over HTTP. SSL has been a
                ranking factor in Google’s algorithm since 2014.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Fix broken pages and links</span> – broken links are harmful for search rankings and
                annoying for users. In the same vein, create a custom 404 page to direct users in case something does go
                wrong.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Optimise internal site structure</span> – organised site architecture makes it easier
                for search bots to crawl your site and makes it much easier for users to navigate. Important pages should
                be closer to the home page in page hierarchy and should have more internal links linking to them.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Decide on a URL structure</span> to organise webpages, based on the internal
                architecture of the site. Decide whether you want to use subfolders <span class="italics">
                (yourdomain.com/shop</span> – my personal preference) or subdirectories <span class="italics">
                (shop.yourdomain.com)</span>. Neither is necessarily better than the other, but you cannot use both at
                once. Short, descriptive URL structures improve site navigability for users and provides additional
                context for web crawlers (if you submit a sitemap, of course).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Use structured data markup</span>, such as Schema or Microformats2, to help the
                algorithm parse and “understand” the page content.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Use semantic and accessible markup</span> so that your site can be accessed by all
                users. Validate your HTML to make sure that it is semantically correct (don’t just use &lt;div&gt; for
                everything…), and make sure that your website complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                (WCAG) 2.1.</li>
            <li>Finally, <span class="bold">ensure that your website is responsive</span> to different screen sizes and
                is usable on mobile – it is likely that many users will be visiting from a mobile browser.</li>
