        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        <p>This site was built as part of a class project, to consolidate everything I’ve learned this semester and to
            serve as a point of reference for me to come back to. The things I have learned and explored about website
            discoverability, including past projects, are included here. Ultimately, this site exists to demonstrate my
            understanding of findability, as well as to help improve the findability of my personal website,
            <a href="https://alexandra.cool">alexandra.cool</a>.</p>
        <h2>Improving Findability</h2>
        <p>This site is registered with popular search engines so that it may be indexed, by submitting a sitemap to
            Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. This also allows me to check regularly and make sure that my
            site is being properly indexed. I’ve also got Google Analytics enabled so I can monitor traffic and see how
            my site is performing (honestly, not too well at the moment…).</p>
        <p>Building inbound links has been a little difficult, as I struggled to find link-building strategies that felt
            appropriate to my website content. When the topic of my site is essentially myself, it’s harder to find a
            ‘niche’ to tap into to put myself on the digital map. Linking to my site on my personal social media is just
            one small place to start, but probably my most effective strategy.</p>
        <p>Any traffic is better than no traffic, and it’s worth taking the time to see what my users are doing (even if
            I can count them all on one hand). It has been fun to watch the total number of visitors slowly increase over
            the last month, with user popping up from all around the world. I always wonder – <span class="italics">
            “What are you doing here? How did you find me?”</span> The thing that interests my most about my users –
            beyond just the pages they visit and how much time they spend there – is where on the internet they come
            from. The source of my users is an indicator of whether my backlinks are effective, and it gives me an idea
            of the platforms I should focus on to further encourage people to my site. Keyword analysis is the other
            biggest thing for me. Keyword density is not my strongest point, so it’s important that I pay attention to
            how my site ranks against competitors, and that I’m constantly improving my content to be helpful and
            relevant to what users are searching for.</p>
        <p>I’ll consider myself successful when Google Analytics doesn’t say “0 new users this week” (small wins, right?).
            Honestly, keeping users engaged and interacting with my site is my main goal for now. If you’ve made it this
            far, please stick around a while :)</p>
